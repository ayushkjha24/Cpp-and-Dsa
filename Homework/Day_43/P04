Column Major Order:
If elements of an array are stored in a column-major fashion means moving across the column 
and then to the next column then it’s in column-major order. To find the address of the element 
using column-major order use the following formula:

Address of A[I][J] = B + W * ((J – LC) * M + (I – LR))  

I = Row Subset of an element whose address to be found, 
J = Column Subset of an element whose address to be found, 
B = Base address, 
W = Storage size of one element store in any array(in byte), 
LR = Lower Limit of row/start row index of matrix(If not given assume it as zero), 
LC = Lower Limit of column/start column index of matrix(If not given assume it as zero), 
M = Number of rows given in the matrix.
